# Introduction
In this assignment, I am going to investigate a car loan then make a JAVA code to discover the monthly repayment that should be made and the amount of principal, interest, and balance of each year.  A car loan is an amount of money taken from a lending provider to purchase a new or used car.  An algorithm such as pseudocode and flow chart should be done before solving the problems by coding after identifying the problem.  To make analysis, car price, down payment, loan period and interest rate are required to be known.  By using the data given under certain specific conditions, the data would be processed, and analysis may be done then the payment schedule can be shown.  This assignment tests me about my understanding of the application (loop, if statements, arrayâ€¦...) in coding and programming.
